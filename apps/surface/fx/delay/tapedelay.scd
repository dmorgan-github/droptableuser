2.104  Tape Delay Simulation (tapeDelay, 1211)

Correctly models the tape motion and some of the smear effect, there is no simulation fo the head saturation yet, as I don't have a good model of it. When I get one I will add it.The way the tape accelerates and decelerates gives a nicer delay effect for many purposes.
