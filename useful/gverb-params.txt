Hints:
For a quick way to apply more or less reverb, try changing the Early reflection level and Tail level values.
Applying GVerb can clip your track, so Effect > Amplify. If the Amplification (db) is a negative value when the "Allow Clipping" box is not checked, press the OK button to decrease the amplification.
For settings that increase the reverberation, you may need to click at the end of the region you want to reverb, Generate > Silence, then include the inserted silence when applying GVerb.
